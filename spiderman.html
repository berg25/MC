    <ul>
      <li>Real Name -  Peter Benjamin Parker</li>
      <br>
      <li>Height - 5'10</li>
      <br>
      <li>Weight - 167lbs</li>
      <br>
      <li>Abilities - Peter is an accomplished scientist, inventor and photographer.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Group Affiliations - Avengers, formerly the Secret Defenders, "New Fantastic Four", the Outlaws</li>
      <br>
      <li>First Appearance - Amazing Fantasy #15 (1962)</li>
      <br>
      <li>Origin - Amazing Fantasy #15 (1962)</li>
      <br>
      <li>Powers - Peter can cling to most surfaces,
                   has superhuman strength (able to lift 10 tons optimally)
                   and is roughly 15 times more agile than a regular human.
                   The combination of his acrobatic leaps and web-slinging
                   enables him to travel rapidly from place to place.
                   His spider-sense provides an early warning detection
                   system linked with his superhuman kinesthetics,
                   enabling him the ability to evade most any injury,
                   provided he doesn't cognitively override the autonomic reflexes.
                   Note: his power enhancements through his transformation by
                   the Queen and after battling Morlun - including his organic
                   web glands and stingers -
                   have been undone after Spider-Man's deal with Mephisto.</li>
