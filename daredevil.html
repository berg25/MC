  <h2> Daredevil </h2>
   <p>  Abandoned by his mother, Matt Murdock was raised by his father, boxer
        "Battling Jack" Murdock, in Hell's Kitchen. Realizing that rules were
        needed to prevent people from behaving badly, young Matt decided to study
        law; however, when he saved a man from an oncoming truck, it spilled a
        radioactive cargo that rendered Matt blind while enhancing his remaining senses.
        Under the harsh tutelage of blind martial arts master Stick,
        Matt mastered his heightened senses and became a formidable fighter.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Real Name -  Matthew Michael Murdock</li>
      <br>
      <li>Height - 6'0"</li>
      <br>
      <li>Weight - 200 lbs.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Abilities - Daredevil possesses the strength, speed, agility, and endurance,
                      not to mention acrobatic and gymnastic skills, of an Olympic-level athlete.
                      Through a combination of the tutelage of Stick and self-training, Daredevil is a master of a unique
                      martial art form, which is a hybridized form of American boxing
                      and the Japanese arts of ninjutsu, judo and aiki-jujutsu.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Group Affiliations - Formerly Defenders, Marvel Knights, "Marvel Knights"</li>
      <br>
      <li>First Appearance - Daredevil #1 (1964)</li>
      <br>
      <li>Origin - Daredevil #1 (1964); Daredevil: The Man Without Fear #1-5 (1993-1994); Daredevil: Yellow #1-6 (2001-2002)</li>
      <br>
      <li>Powers - In compensation for his lost sight, Daredevilâ€™s other four
                   senses have been preternaturally enhanced.His sense of
                   touch is sensitive enough to detect the faint impressions
                   of ink on paper, allowing him to read by touch. He is also
                   able to feel minute changes in temperature and pressure,
                   enough to sense a human body at a distance of five feet,
                   due to body heat and air disturbance. His sensitivity to
                   heat allows him to sense the temperature of people and
                   objects in order to determine whether a person is alive,
                   how long they have been dead if they are not, and other
                   changes in body temperature such as blushing or the heating
                   up associated with various emotional states, as well as
                   residual body heat on an object, or how recently a machine has been in use</li>
